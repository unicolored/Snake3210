# Snake 3210

Let's play the old Snake. Collect apples, make the distance, increase speed and lead the board !

## Installation

It's just HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase. Open it in a modern browser and join the board.

## Inspiration

[JDStraughan](https://github.com/JDStraughan/html5-snake) made the initial version of this oldschool game. Thanks to him.
