Collect apples, make the distance, increase speed and lead the board !","body":"# html5-snake\r\n\r\nOkay, so I'm up to 2 games in my repertoire. \r\n\r\nThe last game, [lightcycles](https://github.com/JDStraughan/html5-lightcycles), was a great learning experience, and I tried to apply some of the lessons learned there to this game.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIt's just HTML, CSS, and javascript.  Open it in a modern browser and have fun.\r\n\r\nToo lazy to download?  [Play it on jsfiddle (may be older version of game)](http://jsfiddle.net/zT7V4/1/).\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\n[lightcycles](https://github.com/JDStraughan/html5-lightcycles) was a blast to write, and it really made me think about how to make my snake move (hehe).  I decided on making and array, and just shift()ing and push()ing segments.  This is what I ended up with.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nYou can fork/fix/add/pull request this repo, and I'll gladly add your code ;)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nIf you issue a pull request, add your name here!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT License - http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jason D.
